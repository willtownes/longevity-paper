```{r}
library(MASS)
```

```{r}
N<-100 #number of perturbations
G<-1000 #number of genes
K<-50 #number of gene clusters (pathways), avg of G/K genes per pathway
L<-20 #latent dimensional space
b<-c(rep(0,15),c(-5,-2,-1,2,5)) #coefficients for survival outcome
x<-1:N #index or which gene is perturbed in each experiment

```

hand code the phi_k coefficient vector prototypes. 2 of 20 are survival related (have large values in last 5 dimensions)
