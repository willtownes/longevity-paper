	abstract = {Reverse-engineering of biological networks is a central problem in systems biology. The use of intervention data, such as gene knockouts or knockdowns, is typically used for teasing apart causal relationships among genes. Under time or resource constraints, one needs to carefully choose which intervention experiments to carry out. Previous approaches for selecting most informative interventions have largely been focused on discrete Bayesian networks. However, continuous Bayesian networks are of great practical interest, especially in the study of complex biological systems and their quantitative properties. In this work, we present an efficient, information-theoretic active learning algorithm for Gaussian Bayesian networks (GBNs), which serve as important models for gene regulatory networks. In addition to providing linear-algebraic insights unique to GBNs, leading to significant runtime improvements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on data simulated with GBNs and the DREAM4 network inference challenge data sets. Our method generally leads to faster recovery of underlying network structure and faster convergence to final distribution of confidence scores over candidate graph structures using the full data, in comparison to random selection of intervention experiments.},

	abstract = {Ageing is driven by a loss of transcriptional and protein homeostasis and is the key risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Interventions that attenuate or reverse systemic dysfunction associated with age therefore have the potential to reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation of the splicing machinery is linked to several age-related chronic illnesses. However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics and in-depth splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or subjected to dietary restriction, we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing with age that are reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1; the C. elegans homologue of SF1, also known as branchpoint binding protein, BBP). We show that SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension by dietary restriction and by modulation of the TORC1 pathway components AMPK, RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 kinase. We also demonstrate that overexpression of SFA-1 is sufficient to extend lifespan. Together, these data demonstrate a role for RNA splicing homeostasis in dietary restriction longevity and suggest that modulation of specific spliceosome components may prolong healthy ageing.},

	abstract = {Background: The inference of gene regulatory networks is of great interest and has various applications. The recent advances in high-throughout biological data collection have facilitated the construction and understanding of gene regulatory networks in many model organisms. However, the inference of gene networks from large-scale human genomic data can be challenging. Generally, it is difficult to identify the correct regulators for each gene in the large search space, given that the high dimensional gene expression data only provides a small number of observations for each gene. Results: We present a Bayesian approach integrating external data sources with knockdown data from human cell lines to infer gene regulatory networks. In particular, we assemble multiple data sources including gene expression data, genome-wide binding data, gene ontology, known pathways and use a supervised learning framework to compute prior probabilities of regulatory relationships. We show that our integrated method improves the accuracy of inferred gene networks. We apply our method to two different human cell lines, which illustrates the general scope of our method. Conclusions: We present a flexible and systematic framework for external data integration that improves the accuracy of human gene network inference while retaining efficiency. Integrating various data sources of biological information also provides a systematic way to build on knowledge from existing literature.},

Less than 7\% of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions.

Many genes that affect replicative lifespan (RLS) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affect aging in other organisms such as C.~elegans and M.~musculus. We performed a systematic analysis of yeast RLS in a set of 4,698 viable single-gene deletion strains. Multiple functional gene clusters were identified, and full genome-to-genome comparison demonstrated a significant conservation in longevity pathways between yeast and C.~elegans. Among the mechanisms of aging identified, deletion of tRNA exporter LOS1 robustly extended lifespan. Dietary restriction (DR) and inhibition of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) exclude Los1 from the nucleus in a Rad53-dependent manner. Moreover, lifespan extension from deletion of LOS1 is nonadditive with DR or mTOR inhibition, and results in Gcn4 transcription factor activation. Thus, the DNA damage response and mTOR converge on Los1-mediated nuclear tRNA export to regulate Gcn4 activity and aging.},

To understand regulatory systems, it would be useful to uniformly determine how different components contribute to the expression of all other genes. We therefore monitored mRNA expression genome-wide, for individual deletions of one-quarter of yeast genes, focusing on (putative) regulators. The resulting genetic perturbation signatures reflect many different properties. These include the architecture of protein complexes and pathways, identification of expression changes compatible with viability, and the varying responsiveness to genetic perturbation. The data are assembled into a genetic perturbation network that shows different connectivities for different classes of regulators. Four feed-forward loop (FFL) types are overrepresented, including incoherent type 2 FFLs that likely represent feedback. Systematic transcription factor classification shows a surprisingly high abundance of gene-specific repressors, suggesting that yeast chromatin is not as generally restrictive to transcription as is often assumed. The data set is useful for studying individual genes and for discovering properties of an entire regulatory system.},

	abstract = {Improving Whole-Genome Screens
Improved methods are needed for the knockout of individual genes in genome-scale functional screens. Wang et al. (p. 80, published online 12 December) and Shalem et al. (p. 84, published online 12 December) used the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system to power-screen protocols that avoid several of the pitfalls associated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens. Genome editing by these methods completely disrupts target genes, thus avoiding weak signals that can occur when transcript abundance is partially decreased by siRNA. Furthermore, gene targeting by the CRISPR system is more precise and appears to produce substantially fewer off-target effects than existing methods.
The simplicity of programming the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats){\textendash}associated nuclease Cas9 to modify specific genomic loci suggests a new way to interrogate gene function on a genome-wide scale. We show that lentiviral delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enables both negative and positive selection screening in human cells. First, we used the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic RAF inhibitor. Our highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12, as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1. We observe a high level of consistency between independent guide RNAs targeting the same gene and a high rate of hit confirmation, demonstrating the promise of genome-scale screening with Cas9.
Genome-editing technology allows improved positive or negative selection screens.

Even in yeast, our knowledge of the number and identity of the genes that determine lifespan is limited and we are still lacking a general picture of how different genetic aging factors work together. Here, using an innovative sensitive technique, we have characterized the stationary-phase survival of yeast single- and double-gene knockout mutants to screen for genes that control chronological aging and to score the genetic interactions among these genes. Our results showed that an important fraction (14\%) of the genome contributes to the regulation of lifespan, including genes and pathways that had not been previously associated to this phenotype. We also constructed a genetic interaction map which recapitulated lifespan-determining pathways and highlighted genetic associations between the autophagy machinery and the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate and lipid-homeostasis pathways. Our study provides not only an accurate catalogue of yeast aging genes, but also a picture of the gene-network wiring of aging cells.},

	abstract = {Dietary restriction is arguably the most promising non-pharmacological intervention to extend human life and health span. Yet, only few genetic regulators mediating the cellular response to dietary restriction are known, and the question remains which other transcription factors and regulatory pathways are involved. To gain a comprehensive view of how lifespan extension under dietary restriction is elicited, we screened the chronological lifespan of most gene deletions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under two dietary regimens, restricted and non-restricted. We identified 472 mutants with enhanced or diminished extension of lifespan by dietary restriction. Functional analysis of such dietary-restriction genes revealed novel processes underlying longevity specifically by dietary restriction. Importantly, this set of genes allowed us to generate a prioritized catalogue of transcription factors orchestrating the dietary-restriction response, which underscored the relevance of cell-cycle arrest control as a key mechanism of chronological longevity in yeast. We show that the transcription factor Ste12 is needed for full lifespan extension and cell-cycle arrest in response to nutrient limitation; linking the pheromone/invasive growth pathway with cell survivorship. Strikingly, STE12 overexpression was sufficient to extend chronological lifespan under non-restricted conditions. Our global picture of the genetic players of longevity by dietary restriction highlights intricate regulatory cross-talks in aging cells.},

	abstract = {To detect overlap or convergence among the diverse genetic pathways that can extend lifespan, we collected a dataset of 60 C.elegans age-dependent transcriptomes by RNA-seq technique for worm strains with vastly different lifespans. We selected four exceptionally long-lived mutants and three examples of the most successful life-extending RNAi treatments (which increased mean lifespan by 35\% rather than 120\% as reported). We used the dataset augmented with publicly available gene expression datasets to produce a transcriptomic signature of biological age. We introduced a transcriptomic measure of biological age and observed that its dependence on chronological age is modulated by a single parameter, the rate of aging. We hypothesized that the scaling revealed in the gene expression kinetics underlies the recently observed scaling of the survival curves in C.elegans, and the stochasticity in gene expressions leads to deceleration of mortality with age, reaching a plateau at advanced ages. Using experimental survival data, we confirm that the plateau mortality agrees closely with the estimate of Gompertz exponent at the cross-over age near the mean lifespan. The genes associated with aging in our data are enriched with the targets of transcription factors such as DAF-16, ELT-2, ELT-6, NHR-10, ZTF-9, NHR-86, and miRNAs including miR-57, -59, and -244, which is in agreement with previous studies. Overall, our meta-analysis results are consistent with a concept of aging based on critical dynamics of molecular level variables (e.g., gene expression), and support our view of aging as arising from dynamic instability of a single (critical) mode.},

	abstract = {Broadly speaking, supervised machine learning is the computational task of learning correlations between variables in annotated data (the training set), and using this information to create a predictive model capable of inferring annotations for new data, whose annotations are not known. Ageing is a complex process that affects nearly all animal species. This process can be studied at several levels of abstraction, in different organisms and with different objectives in mind. Not surprisingly, the diversity of the supervised machine learning algorithms applied to answer biological questions reflects the complexities of the underlying ageing processes being studied. Many works using supervised machine learning to study the ageing process have been recently published, so it is timely to review these works, to discuss their main findings and weaknesses. In summary, the main findings of the reviewed papers are: the link between specific types of DNA repair and ageing; ageing-related proteins tend to be highly connected and seem to play a central role in molecular pathways; ageing/longevity is linked with autophagy and apoptosis, nutrient receptor genes, and copper and iron ion transport. Additionally, several biomarkers of ageing were found by machine learning. Despite some interesting machine learning results, we also identified a weakness of current works on this topic: only one of the reviewed papers has corroborated the computational results of machine learning algorithms through wet-lab experiments. In conclusion, supervised machine learning has contributed to advance our knowledge and has provided novel insights on ageing, yet future work should have a greater emphasis in validating the predictions.},

In this work, we introduce new hierarchical feature selection methods for the classification task of data mining and apply them to ageing-related data from four model organisms: Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Drosophila melanogaster (fly), and Mus musculus (mouse). The main novel aspect of the proposed feature selection methods is that they exploit hierarchical relationships in the set of features (Gene Ontology terms) in order to improve the predictive accuracy of the Na{\"i}ive Bayes and 1-Nearest Neighbour (1-NN) classifiers, which are used to classify model organisms' genes into pro-longevity or anti-longevity genes. The results show that our hierarchical feature selection methods, when used together with Na{\"i}ive Bayes and 1-NN classifiers, obtain higher predictive accuracy than the standard (without feature selection) Na{\"i}ive Bayes and 1-NN classifiers, respectively. We also discuss the biological relevance of a number of Gene Ontology terms very frequently selected by our algorithms in our datasets.},

We constructed a reference database or {\textquotedblleft}compendium{\textquotedblright} of expression profiles corresponding to 300 diverse mutations and chemical treatments in S. cerevisiae, and we show that the cellular pathways affected can be determined by pattern matching, even among very subtle profiles. The utility of this approach is validated by examining profiles caused by deletions of uncharacterized genes: we identify and experimentally confirm that eight uncharacterized open reading frames encode proteins required for sterol metabolism, cell wall function, mitochondrial respiration, or protein synthesis. We also show that the compendium can be used to characterize pharmacological perturbations by identifying a novel target of the commonly used drug dyclonine.},

	abstract = {We explored genomic expression patterns in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae responding to diverse environmental transitions. DNA microarrays were used to measure changes in transcript levels over time for almost every yeast gene, as cells responded to temperature shocks, hydrogen peroxide, the superoxide-generating drug menadione, the sulfhydryl-oxidizing agent diamide, the disulfide-reducing agent dithiothreitol, hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock, amino acid starvation, nitrogen source depletion, and progression into stationary phase. A large set of genes (\~{} 900) showed a similar drastic response to almost all of these environmental changes. Additional features of the genomic responses were specialized for specific conditions. Promoter analysis and subsequent characterization of the responses of mutant strains implicated the transcription factors Yap1p, as well as Msn2p and Msn4p, in mediating specific features of the transcriptional response, while the identification of novel sequence elements provided clues to novel regulators. Physiological themes in the genomic responses to specific environmental stresses provided insights into the effects of those stresses on the cell.},

	abstract = {Reverse engineering methods are typically first tested on simulated data from in silico networks, for systematic and efficient performance assessment, before an application to real biological networks. In this paper, we present a method for generating biologically plausible in silico networks, which allow realistic performance assessment of network inference algorithms. Instead of using random graph models, which are known to only partly capture the structural properties of biological networks, we generate network structures by extracting modules from known biological interaction networks. Using the yeast transcriptional regulatory network as a test case, we show that extracted modules have a biologically plausible connectivity because they preserve functional and structural properties of the original network. Our method was selected to generate the {\textquotedblleft}gold standard{\textquotedblright} networks for the gene network reverse engineering challenge of the third DREAM conference (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods 2008, Cambridge, MA).},

	abstract = {Ageing has a huge impact on human health and economy, but its molecular basis {\textendash} regulation and mechanism {\textendash} is still poorly understood. By today, more than three hundred genes (almost all of them function as protein-coding genes) have been related to human ageing. Although individual ageing-related genes or some small subsets of these genes have been intensively studied, their analysis as a whole has been highly limited. To fill this gap, for each human protein we extracted 21000 protein features from various databases, and using these data as an input to state-of-the-art machine learning methods, we classified human proteins as ageing-related or non-ageing-related. We found a simple classification model based on only 36 protein features, such as the {\textquotedblleft}number of ageing-related interaction partners{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}response to oxidative stress{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}damaged DNA binding{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}rhythmic process{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}extracellular region{\textquotedblright}. Predicted values of the model quantify the relevance of a given protein in the regulation or mechanisms of the human ageing process. Furthermore, we identified new candidate proteins having strong computational evidence of their important role in ageing. Some of them, like Cytochrome b-245 light chain (CY24A) and Endoribonuclease ZC3H12A (ZC12A) have no previous ageing-associated annotations.},
